Robot Name
Write a program that manages robot factory settings.

When robots come off the factory floor, they have no name. The first time you boot them up, a random name 
is generated, such as RX837 or BC811.

Every once in a while, we need to reset a robot to its factory settings, which means that their name gets 
wiped. The next time you ask, it will respond with a new random name.

The names must be random; they should not follow a predictable sequence. Random names means there is a 
risk of collisions. Your solution should not allow the use of the same name twice when avoidable.

# Problem
Write a program that generates a random "robot name"

# Example
Robot.new.name == random name
robot.reset == different random name

# Data
- string

# Algo
constants: 0-9, A-Z

constructor
- assign a robot name
- current_name
- getter/setter for name

reset
- reassigns name
- checks it is not the same as the previous before assigning

name_picker
- generates random name from number/letter constants
=end

class Robot
  attr_accessor :name
  @@names = []

  def initialize
    @name = name_picker
  end

  def name_picker
    alpha = ("A".."Z").to_a
    nums = (0..9).to_a
    new_name = []

    2.times {new_name << alpha.sample}
    3.times {new_name << nums.sample}
    new_name = new_name.join
    validate_original_name(new_name)
    new_name
  end

  def validate_original_name(new_name)
    if @@names.include?(new_name)
      self.name = name_picker
    else
      @@names << name
    end
  end

  def reset
    self.name = name_picker
  end
end

LS Solution
# Problem
For our program, the details we need to keep in mind are as follows:

Since robot names are created randomly without input from a user, our program doesn't need to expect any 
input argument. The name we later return will be a string.
A robot's name is generated the first time it is booted up after being manufactured as well as the first 
time it is booted up after a factory reset.
The randomly generated names seem to follow a pattern of 2 uppercase alphabetic characters followed by 
three digits.

# Examples
From the test cases shown above, we can see that we need to create a Robot class. The class should have 
2 methods as follows:

a method named name that returns the robots randomly generated name (a string). The format of the name is 
2 uppercase alphabet characters followed by three digits.
a method named reset that restores the robot to factory functions. This means that any previously existing 
name for the robot is wiped and a new one must be generated.
We may also want to create some helper methods to assist us, but those are optional.

# Data
We know that we will be working with strings in order to generate and return a robot's name.

The problem description stated that we should make an effort to avoid collisions of the randomly 
generated names for various robots. This suggests that we might also want to use a static or class-level 
collection such as an array in order to track random names that have already been assigned to instances of 
the Robot class.

# Algo
Method: name

If the robot already has a name assigned, return that name.
If the robot does not yet have a name:
Generate a random name (using helper function).
Continue generating random names until the class-level collection being used to track names of existing 
robots does not include the newly generated name.
Save the robot's new name.
Save the name in the class-level collection used to track in-use names.
Return the name.

Method: reset

Remove the current value of the robot's name from the class-level collection that tracks the in-use names 
of all existing robots.

Remove the existing value of the robot's name from the object.

A falsy placeholder value might be appropriate

Helper Method to generate name

Begin with an empty name string.
Generate two random uppercase alphabetic characters and append them to the name string.
A helper function might be useful for generating the random letters.
Generate three random digits from 0-9 and append them to the name string.
A helper function might be useful for generating the random digits.
Return the name string.

# Code
class Robot
  @@names = []

  def name
    return @name if @name
    @name = generate_name while @@names.include?(@name) || @name.nil?
    @@names << @name
    @name
  end

  def reset
    @@names.delete(@name)
    @name = nil
  end

  private

  def generate_name
    name = ''
    2.times { name << rand(65..90).chr }
    3.times { name << rand(0..9).to_s }
    name
  end
end

Discussion
The Robot class has a class variable names, which is an array that holds all of the currently taken names 
for instances of the Robot class.

The name method simply returns the robots name if one has already been assigned. Otherwise, the helper 
method generate_name is repeatedly invoked until a unique name (one that is not present in the names array) 
has been assigned. The newly generated unique name is added to the static names array and then returned 
from the method.

Our generate_name method concatenates two random alphabetic characters and three random digits onto the 
name string and returns the resulting name. We use rand to find a random character in the ranges we provide. 
For the letters, we use their corresponding ASCII codes to choose a random number, then convert that number 
to a letter using chr.

The reset method uses the built-in Array#delete method to delete the instance of the current name from our 
list of used names. We do this so that the name is free to be used by instances of Robot created in the 
future. We then reset the current robot's name to nil.
